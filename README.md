Apocalypse v0.1

You must download the entire folder and keep _internal & main.exe within the same directory for main to run. thx <3

Starting notes:
- For gender, type either 'm' or 'f'
- Type in 'help' on the input prompt for a list of commands
- Type in 'achievements' to look at the achievements as with which ones are locked/unlocked

Future changes:
- Delay between cutscene lines (no delay rn to make testing easier)
- More stages
- More achievements
- Refining of print displays
- Ally and relationship mechanics
- Saving & loading
- Stage creator (maybe)
- Random stage generation (maybe)
